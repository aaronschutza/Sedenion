# Sedenion Cryptography Suite (Post-Quantum)

This repository contains a novel, high-performance suite of Post-Quantum cryptographic primitives built entirely on the mathematical foundations of the 16-dimensional **Sedenion Algebra** (via the Cayley-Dickson construction). 

By exploiting the inherent topological impedance of the Sedenions—specifically their profound lack of commutativity, associativity, and alternativity—this architecture neutralizes the algebraic shortcuts and linearization techniques relied upon by both classical algebraic attackers and quantum adversaries (e.g., Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm).



## The Cryptographic Primitives

This suite implements four distinct cryptographic engines:

* **SUOV (Sedenionic Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar):** A multivariate signature scheme hardened by non-associative noise.
* **SQE (Sedenionic Quantum Encapsulation):** A secure key encapsulation mechanism.
* **S-ZKPoK (Sedenionic Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge):** A zero-knowledge proving system utilizing the massive combinatorial trapdoors of 16-dimensional cross-terms.
* **S-VDF (Sedenionic Verifiable Delay Function):** A strictly sequential time-lock puzzle paired with a hyper-optimized Plonky3 STARK proving engine.

## The Flagship: S-VDF (Sedenionic Verifiable Delay Function)

The S-VDF solves the modern Prover Latency Bottleneck by combining a highly chaotic, strictly sequential mathematical evaluation with an incredibly lightweight STARK arithmetization (Degree 3).

### The Chaotic Walk
The time-lock is generated by forcing a state vector through a massive, non-associative chaotic walk:

$$X_{t+1} = (X_t \times G_t) \times X_t$$

Where $X_t$ is the 16-dimensional Sedenion state, and $G_t$ is a cyclic generator shifting through the basis dimensions ($e_0, e_1, \dots, e_{15}$). Because the Sedenions are non-associative, the order of operations cannot be collapsed. An attacker cannot use standard modular exponentiation shortcuts (like Fermat's Little Theorem or square-and-multiply) to bypass the sequential steps.

### Preventing Dimensional Collapse
To prevent the algebra from collapsing into a commutative 2D plane (which would allow an attacker to bypass the time-lock), the S-VDF is strictly initialized using a secure hash function (`Keccak256` / `SHA-256`). This guarantees that all 16 dimensions of the starting state are densely populated with pseudo-random entropy, forcing the algebra to generate maximum cross-term turbulence.

### The STARK Engine (Plonky3)
Traditional VDFs require heavy hash oracles (like Poseidon or SHA) which bloat STARK execution traces and lead to massive proving times. By relying strictly on the topological impedance of the Sedenion algebra, our Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) requires only a maximum constraint degree of **3**. 

This allows the Plonky3 FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon IOP of Proximity) proving engine to compress millions of computational steps into a succinct verification receipt in seconds, purely on CPU.
